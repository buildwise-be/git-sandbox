# git-sandbox
Sandbox for the git training.
The goal of this repository is to play with git commands without hurting any other project


The commits on the main branch are then restricted, so you are forced to create a branch and a pull request.

> [!CAUTION]
> This repository was set as a public repository to enable branch protection rules.
> Make sure you don't include proprietary or offending content during the training session
